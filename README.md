# Clustering-Evaluation

First Step: Form Clusters with 2 different methods and visualize them:
  1-using K-means: set K=2,3,4,5,6. 
  2-K-ways normalized: cut k=2,3,4,5,6. Use Similarity graph as the {3,5}-NNgraph.
  
Second Step: Some External Evaluation Methods:  
1. Conditional Entropy
2. Purity
3. Pairwise measures (Jaccard and Rand index)
4. Max matching when number of clusters =3.
5. F-Measure

Third Step: Some Internal Evaluation Methods:  
1. BetaCV
2. Normalized-Cut
